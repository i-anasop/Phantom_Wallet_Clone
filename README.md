# 🚀 Phantom Wallet Clone (Python)

Phantom Wallet Simulator is a **professional, educational, and security-oriented** Python desktop application that simulates a Phantom-style cryptocurrency wallet with enterprise-grade cryptography, data structures, and a clean modern UI.

It provides a complete crypto wallet experience with deterministic seed phrases, transaction simulation, crypto balances, QR addressing, security logs, and a responsive purple-themed Phantom UI — all inside a **single Python file**.
